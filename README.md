# Cat vs Dog Image Classification using SVM

This project implements a **binary image classification system** to distinguish between **cats and dogs** using a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** algorithm.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to apply a classical machine learning approach to an image classification problem and understand the complete ML pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- OpenCV  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset consists of labeled images of **cats** and **dogs**
- Images are resized and flattened before being fed into the SVM model

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. Image loading and preprocessing  
2. Feature extraction  
3. Train-test split  
4. Model training using Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
5. Performance evaluation using accuracy score  

## 📊 Results
- The trained SVM model successfully classifies images into **Cat** or **Dog**
- Model performance is evaluated using accuracy and prediction analysis
